- Not all of the Effects of computing are anticipated in advance 
- Unexpected negative effects may arise unexpectedly
- Computing also provides services to almost all industries and fields 

- Microtransactions
- Microtransactions are a common way for free apps to make money through pay to win items or cosmetics 
- People can be enticed to buy loot boxes that provide them with more progression in the game
- Programmers won’t know the effects of the things that they create

- The internet 
- The internet can also cause people to develop sleep deprivation, anxiety, and depression 
- Most of our lives are deeply connected to the internet
- We rely on the internet too much sometimes, spend too much time online

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

- It is a lot easier to complete tasks for school or work with the accessibility of the internet. However, the internet is a dangerous place, you can have your information stolen by hackers or data leaks. 

- It is easier to make friends on the internet since everyone has access to social media. People can talk to each other through DMs or video chats as well. An issue with this is cyberbullying, people are able to bully others online with social media being so accessible on the internet. 

- It is also easier to learn more about skills that you want to develop by watching videos or courses online. Learning skills online is a lot easier because there are more resources available. But you lose the social skills that you develop in the process, learning social skills is also as important as learning any other skill. 

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

- I think that Dopamine issues are a real thing, we can become hooked onto electronics through the playing of video games. I think that parents have a right to be concerned about video games because they can cause the quality of schoolwork and social life to decrease. I used to get distracted by video games and my phone when I am studying for school or trying to get work done at home. I have made better habits to prevent myself from becoming like Rosner and his video game addiction.

1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

- People can empower themselves in the digital world by learning skills that will allow them to thrive on the internet. Knowing certain skills that will separate them from others will likely lead to more success in the future. 

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

- People that are empowered can help someone that is not empowered by helping those that don’t have access to the internet. I can give somebody my hotspot if their wifi is not working so that they can access the internet.
