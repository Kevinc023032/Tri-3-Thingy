 # Test Prep Study 
 
### Unit 5.1 Notes

- There are benefits and harmful effects of technology on people 
Wii:
- Benefits: Allows you to be active while playing video games 
  - Harmful: injuries, broken tv
- Multirotor:
  - Benefits: Capable of deliveries, aerial photographs
  - Harmful: Unregulated flying can be dangerous, invasion of privacy 
- Not all of the Effects of computing are anticipated in advance 
- Unexpected negative effects may arise unexpectedly
- Computing also provides services to almost all industries and fields 

- Microtransactions
- Microtransactions are a common way for free apps to make money through pay to win items or cosmetics 
- People can be enticed to buy loot boxes that provide them with more progression in the game
- Programmers won’t know the effects of the things that they create
- Companies use targeted advertising to properly target their customer’s needs
- The internet 
- The internet can also cause people to develop sleep deprivation, anxiety, and depression 
- Most of our lives are deeply connected to the internet
- We rely on the internet too much sometimes, spend too much time online

### GH Actions
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

- It is a lot easier to complete tasks for school or work with the accessibility of the internet. However, the internet is a dangerous place, you can have your information stolen by hackers or data leaks. 

- It is easier to make friends on the internet since everyone has access to social media. People can talk to each other through DMs or video chats as well. An issue with this is cyberbullying, people are able to bully others online with social media being so accessible on the internet. 

- It is also easier to learn more about skills that you want to develop by watching videos or courses online. Learning skills online is a lot easier because there are more resources available. But you lose the social skills that you develop in the process, learning social skills is also as important as learning any other skill. 

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

- I think that Dopamine issues are a real thing, we can become hooked onto electronics through the playing of video games. I think that parents have a right to be concerned about video games because they can cause the quality of schoolwork and social life to decrease. I used to get distracted by video games and my phone when I am studying for school or trying to get work done at home. I have made better habits to prevent myself from becoming like Rosner and his video game addiction. 


### Unit 5.2 Notes

- The access to the internet varies between social classes, countries, and geography
- Digital Divide: the different amount of access to the internet which can be affected by geography and age
- Some countries don’t have the infrastructure to provide everybody with access to the internet 
  - Some people in rural areas don’t have access to computers
- Access to electricity can be limited in certain areas
  - Not everybody can afford to own a computer as well
- The digital divide can impact people and countries as a whole
- The digital divide can influence other issues to arise such as poverty 
  - Most countries rely on the internet to thrive and grow 
- The internet helps protect countries from outside threats and influences 

### GH Actions

1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

- People can empower themselves in the digital world by learning skills that will allow them to thrive on the internet. Knowing certain skills that will separate them from others will likely lead to more success in the future. 

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

- People that are empowered can help someone that is not empowered by helping those that don’t have access to the internet. I can give somebody my hotspot if their wifi is not working so that they can access the internet.

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- The use of red tape blocks digital empowerment because people are required to follow more steps and procedures in order to obtain information or complete something. I think we have similar barriers at Del Norte because we have to enter multiple passwords in order to access my connect or my plan. 

### 5.3 Computing Bias
- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development

### GH Actions

- The owner of the computer thinks this was intentional but most likely being a bug in the software as it was not tested enough.
- I think this happened because they tested the motion tracking of the face using a white model
- This can be very harmful and be percieved as racist and therefore should be corrected.
- To have a better result I would use different facial models and a wide variety of people to test the software.

### 5.4: Crowdsourcing
 Public Data Sets:
- Kaggle
- Google Public Datasets
- Data.gov
Local Government
Widespread access to info and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions and dissemination of results.
Distributed Computing:
A ton of computers do 1 task
Examples:
Spotify with artists's playlists
Crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and GoFundMe
Coinbase that allows you to buy crypto

### GH Actions

1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- The 150 computer science principle students can help those affected by the russian invasion in ukraine. We can use crowdsourcing as a way to work together and accomplish our goals. We can set up a go fund me where people can donate to support people living in ukraine. 
2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
-  I think that Del Norte can use crowdsoucing to help solve some issues that we are facing . My final could be better with crowdsoucing since we can work better together.

### 5.5: Legal and Ethical Concerns
- Things created on the internet are propety of the creators
- Copyright gives your IP protection and prevents people from using it 
- Intellectual property: a work or invention that is the result of creativity where they have the rights to create things
- You can use materials created by others using Creative commons, open source, open access
- Creative commons: gives free licences to others and how the creations can be used 
- Open source: an online source that is free form any restrictions and is free to use 
- Open access: online sources that are distrubed online and is openly available 

### GH Actions

1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
2. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.

### 5.6: Safe Computing
- PII is your personal Identifiable Information such as social security, phone numbers, emails, date of birth
- 
### GH Actions

1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
2. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
5. Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
