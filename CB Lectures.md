### College Board Lecture Notes

## Week 5: Computer Systems and Networks
### CSN-1
- CheckSums: a small-sized block of data derived from another block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage
- One of the most common types of Checksums are barcodes and credit cards
- Barcodes contain information about the price & weight of the product, date of manufacturing and expiry, name of the manufacturer 
Other types of checksums
- CDs, DVDs, hard drives
- Verifying software downloads 
- Using SHA-256, a cryptographic function
- Downloads are verified by a hexadecimal function which has 256 bits
- Ethernet, TCP/IP, WiFi
- Deep Space Probes
- Computer systems are important because they are responsible for storing and transmitting information 
- It’s important for computers to be reliable despite unreliable environments

### CSN-2
- Memory processors have been getting more powerful over time
- With transistors getting exponentially faster the frequency and power exponentially increased as well
- People decided to flatten the speed of the processors so that the power needed wouldn’t be ridiculously high 
- This also allowed for the temperatures to remain fairly constant over time, making it easier to cool processors
- The processors weren’t improving as much since there wasn’t enough power to increase the clock rate
- Adding more cores to the processors allowed for parallel app performance
- Parallel processing is difficult but it is the only path to better performance and lowering energy consumption 
- Other processors in phones and watches also contain this technology 
- Amdahl’s law: The speedup of processors achieved through parallelism is limited by the serial portion of the program 
- Having more cores can create new problems 
- Some Factors for the issues: Differing speeds, overwriting and reorganizing the work 

## Week 6: Creative Development 
### CRD 1
- Incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing innovations as they are developed.
- A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function.
 - Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it.
 - Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations.
 - Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and documents.
 - Common models such as pair programming exist to facilitate collaboration.
 - Effective collaborative teams practice interpersonal skills:
- Communication
- Consensus building
- Conflict resolution
- Negotiation

### CRD 2

- The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
- An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation.
- Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program.
- Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.
- A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature.
- There are multiple development processes: investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping,testing
- Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program
- constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.
-  Some ways investigation can be performed by: collecting data through surveys, user testing, interviews, direct observations
 - A program’s specification defines the requirements for the program.
 - In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification.
- The design phase of a program consists of:Brainstorming, planning and storyboarding, creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface, development of a testing strategy for the program
- Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed.
- A logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly.
- A syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed.
- A run-time error is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program. Programming languages define their own runtime errors.
- An overflow error is an error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values.
- Most Effective way to find and correct errors: test cases, hand tracing, visualizations, debuggers

## Week 7 Impact of Computing

### IOC 1

- The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
- Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
- Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended:
- The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community
- Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals
- Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or the culture
- Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses
- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
- The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development
Public Data Sets: Kaggle, Google Public Datasets, Data.gov, Local Government
- Widespread access to info and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results.
Open-source:
-programs are freely available and can be modified/redistributed
Open access:
- Online research output free of restriction access like copyright and licensing
Intellectual Property: (IP), work or invention that's a result of creativity to which one has rights
- Creative Commons: Provides a free license to tell others how ur gonna use their IP
- Defines the usage of IP
Copyright: 
- Protects your IP and keeps anybody from using it unless you get permission
- Legal ways to use material
- Open source
- Open access
- Creative Commons

### IOC 2

- Info specific to an individual
- Can be used to steal/impersonate somebody
- (PII) Search engines maintain a history of what you search
- Search history is used to suggest other websites for marketing
- Can collect location
- GOOD
- Can enhance the user's experience
- BAD
- Can be exploited if privacy is ignored
- Etc. Cookies and trackers
- Risks to Privacy:

- Google knows where you live, and your IP
- WiFi signal may be tracked
- Stores w/ cameras can store your image
- All this info can be put online, which is hard to get rid of
- This info could be used against you and it could give other info about you that you didn't intend to share
- Authentication:
- Authentication measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access
- Virus and Malware: Can copy and gain access to your information, Intended to harm and damage a computer
- Encryption: Prevents unauthorized access
- Decryption: Decoding data
