## CSN-1
- CheckSums: a small-sized block of data derived from another block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage
- One of the most common types of Checksums are barcodes and credit cards
- Barcodes contain information about the price & weight of the product, date of manufacturing and expiry, name of the manufacturer 
Other types of checksums
- CDs, DVDs, hard drives
- Verifying software downloads 
- Using SHA-256, a cryptographic function
- Downloads are verified by a hexadecimal function which has 256 bits
- Ethernet, TCP/IP, WiFi
- Deep Space Probes
- Computer systems are important because they are responsible for storing and transmitting information 
- It’s important for computers to be reliable despite unreliable environments

## CSN-2
- Memory processors have been getting more powerful over time
- With transistors getting exponentially faster the frequency and power exponentially increased as well
- People decided to flatten the speed of the processors so that the power needed wouldn’t be ridiculously high 
- This also allowed for the temperatures to remain fairly constant over time, making it easier to cool processors
- The processors weren’t improving as much since there wasn’t enough power to increase the clock rate
- Adding more cores to the processors allowed for parallel app performance
- Parallel processing is difficult but it is the only path to better performance and lowering energy consumption 
- Other processors in phones and watches also contain this technology 
- Amdahl’s law: The speedup of processors achieved through parallelism is limited by the serial portion of the program 
- Having more cores can create new problems 
- Some Factors for the issues: Differing speeds, overwriting and reorganizing the work
